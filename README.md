# Digital Grocery Basket Analysis: A Portfolio Case Study
This data analysis project aims to uncover sales patterns to increase relevance for both internal and external stakeholders of Instacart.

ðŸ’¡ **Context**
This project focused on building Python skills, particularly in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, before moving on to data visualization. The dataset, originally from Kaggle, is provided by San Francisco-based Instacart, a same-day grocery delivery service. Please note that for this project, the dataset was modified by the educational institute of the Data Analytics Career Program Iâ€™m enrolled in.

ðŸ“Š **Executive Summary**
With customers looking for more personalized promotions and product recommendations, the VP of Marketing aiming to improve targeting, and the Senior VP of Sales focused on boosting sales in low-market-share areas, this analysis centers on digital grocery basket behavior. Leveraging my experience as a stakeholder, I developed strong, data-driven customer profiles. Interestingly, the data revealed minimal behavioral differences across the customer base, indicating that digital grocery shopping might represent a distinct use case, further separating itself from traditional grocery shopping. Despite this, the customer personas I created provided valuable insights and actionable strategies.

**My key findings:**
* The majority of orders occur between 10 AM and 3 PM on weekends, while the highest spending per customer happens at night.
* Customers primarily focus on essential items, with produce, dairy/eggs, and snacks being the top three departments by total order volume.
* Regular customers make the most purchases, while the Urban Shopper profile has the highest minimum average spending.

**Summary of recommendations:**
* **Localization:** Purchase patterns by department are consistent across regions within each customer profile.
* **Communication:** Customer profiles can be themed around popular departments: Conscious Shopper = Fresh, Family Shopper = Convenience, Urban Shopper = On-the-Go.
* **Targeting:** Niche departments like International, Babies, and Alcohol have the lowest purchase shares, despite being key for their respective customer profiles.

# **Portfolio Highlights**
This project highlighted my ability to turn abstract customer data into actionable, relatable profiles and demonstrated my strength in hypothesis formation. Most importantly, it showcased my skills in creating a well-structured and clean Python notebook. The code was efficient, with outputs displayed only when necessary, and accompanied by clear, concise comments. I also prioritized readability through thoughtful layout and formatting, ensuring the focus remained on the clarity of the code itself.

**Project delivarables**
This repository includes a project folder that demonstrates my familiarity with standard work practices. It also contains a data insights & visualization sheet highlighting key findings. Lastly, Iâ€™ve provided a direct link to my Python notebook for easy access to the final achievements of this project. [Go to my Final Achievement Notebook]()
